1.0beta 2018-04-22

Features implemented:
- OMeta engine
  - application with arguments
    - prepending extra arguments to input stream
  - application of standard Lua functions
  - "application" of *Types::Any* subtype - type inclusion test (*instanceOf*)
  - foreign application
    - single Rule from "foreign" Grammar (namespace) within current parsing context
    - switching parsing contexts - embedding whole Grammars
  - memoization
    - prepended arguments memoization - default
    - direct arguments (forwarded to Lua function) memoization on demand
  - left recursion
- Streams
  - list streams
    - character stream
    - table (array) stream
    - binary (byte) stream
  - prepending streams
  - property stream (matching named table properties)
- Input
  - string - create character stream
  - file
    - create character stream - text mode, default
    - create binary (byte) stream - binary mode
  - table
    - create table (array) stream
    - create property streams - "random access"
- Grammar class
  - merge Rules - cloning Rules from existing Grammars into "derived" one
- Rule class
  - defining packages of Rules (Grammars)
  - defining standalone Rule
  - direct Rule application
    - match string
    - match table (array)
    - match sequence of mixed elements
    - match file
      - match text file
      - match binary file
- Writing sources
  - syntax extension for writing Grammars - new Keyword (*ometa*)
  - syntax extension for writing standalone Rules - new Keyword (*rule*)
  - syntax extension for string interpolation - new Special character (*backtick*)
- Type system
  - Literal data types
  - AST classes for Lua abstract syntax
  - AST classes for OMeta abstract syntax
  - Array type for convenient manipulation of Node sequences
  - multiple inheritance with C3 method resolution order
  - *getType* global function to get instance type
  - `type::isInstance(instance : any) : boolean` - method for type inclusion testing
- Grammars implemented
  - standalone Lua 5.1 Grammar
  - standalone Lua 5.2 Grammar - as 5.1 extension
  - standalone OMeta Grammar
  - Lua embedded in OMeta Grammar for Host Nodes
  - complete OMeta embedded in Lua Grammar - for source text
  - OMeta in Lua mixed content Grammar - for heterogeneous streams
- Translation
  - reference OMeta abstract syntax into Lua abstract syntax translator
  - Lua abstract syntax into Lua source translator
    - implemented as OMeta Grammar
    - implemented as feature of Lua abstract syntax Node types (*toLuaSource* method)

Non-functional "features":
- OMeta/Lua Grammar is not exactly the same as OMeta/JS Grammar. There are some differences resulting from adaptation to Lua specifics and from slightly different assumptions.
- Current optimization is poor. Reference OMeta AST to Lua AST translator produces a simple but inefficient code. A new version of translator producing more "linear" (optimizable better) Lua source code will be available "soon".
- The Naming convention for types and features is deliberately non-Luaish. This is due to the fact that the project is part of a larger effort based on such a specifications as Unified Modeling Language or Meta-Object Facility and the convention was adopted in accordance with those specifications.
